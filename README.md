# Homework Hub!

**(i) Project Description**

COVID-19 and distance learning have had a detrimental effect on students' mental health. Isolated from friends, students feel alone and struggle to complete problem sets without on-campus resources.

A platform for students to collaborate while creating meaningful connections, Homework Hub aims to combat these challenges. Students can login and indicate that they're currently working on homework for certain classes. Then, others in those classes can reach out to work on homework together.

*We created this web app with the Django framework, which is written in Python and interacts with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. We also used Bootstrap for some of our CSS.*

**(ii) Purpose**

All our group members expressed that distance learning lacks important aspects of in-person college life. We want to hit other people up but fear rejection. We can't easily locate classmates working on the latest pset in the dorm lounge. We waste time floundering alone and feeling frustrated.

Homework Hub has the potential to foster strong connections, even when students return to campus. In the short term, it's unlikely that students will be able to return to campus and interact as they did before coronavirus. Homework Hub can help there. Furthermore, even after the pandemic subsides, if a student is unable to interact with peers in person — for example, due to illness or disability — they can log onto Homework Hub and instantly find classmates to work with and talk to online.

**(iii) How it works**

After creating an account and adding their courses, students can click buttons to indicate when they are working on certain classes, as well as view who else is available. By sending out this "bat signal" of availability, students indicate that they are happy to work with peers. Thus, classmates should not be afraid to reach out!
